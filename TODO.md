# Yume Renderer

## Todo List

The following tasks and features are planned for future development:

### Improvements
- [ ] Fix object rendering issues when it is close to the camera, resulting in unpredictable line patterns.

### Rendering Techniques
- [x] Implement back-face culling to improve rendering performance by only drawing visible faces.
- [ ] Add lighting support to enhance the visual appearance of objects with different light sources and shading.

### File Format Support
- [ ] Add support for loading and rendering .obj files to enable more complex 3D models in the renderer.
